Working on AI techs for business in [NAVER](https://naver.com), [Clova AI](https://clova.ai).
Before joining the AI industry, there were many game dev projects I enjoyed. The latest project was [Unreal.js](https://github.com/ncsoft/unreal.js).

Turbo Pascal was my first favorite language, but I moved on Turbo C++(MSVC), Python, Lua, Javascript and back to Python for ML.

#### Current Topics
1. HyperCLOVA X Seed Open-sourcing
    - Our organization recently released new updates to our sovereign foundation model, HyperCLOVA X, including enhanced reasoning capabilities and native support for vision understanding and speech generation.
    - Most importantly, we are open-sourcing a family of compact yet powerful model variants to support the sovereignty movement and accelerate AI transformation for businesses of all sizes in Korea.
    - Stay tuned for a new technical report outlining the architecture, training methodology, multimodal capabilities, and more.

2. HyperCLOVA X THINK Technical Report
    - We recently introduced HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language model in the HyperCLOVA X family.
    - It is pre-trained on roughly 6 trillion high-quality Korean and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic Korean data.
    - The model is implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN Transformer scaled with Î¼P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum that expands the context window to 128K tokens, and post-trained via supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards.
    - It delivers competitive performance on Korea-focused benchmarks while preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. A vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM benchmark with substantially lower training compute.
    - We also presented a pruning and distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an open-source and business-friendly foundation model.
